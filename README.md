# ImmoEliza, Challenge-Regression
[![Immo Elisa project](https://github.com/JulienAlardot/ImmoElisa/actions/workflows/Immo-Elisa.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/JulienAlardot/ImmoElisa/actions/workflows/Immo-Elisa.yml)

This project was made during an AI formation at [Becode](https://becode.org/). The main goals of the project were :

1. Create a new database by scrapping real-estate websites
2. Clean and analyse the database
3. Preprocess the data for the machine learning algorithms
4. Find the best algorithm and search for the optimum parameters 
    
The different repositories for each step of the projects are:
1. [Database Creation](https://github.com/JulienAlardot/challenge-collecting-data)
2. [Data Analysis](https://github.com/JulienAlardot/ImmoElizaVisu)
3. [Machine learning preprocessing and Deployment (this step)](https://github.com/JulienAlardot/ImmoElisa)


The challenges for this project are extracting the necessary features in a way that would be
useful for the algorithms.

To fill  the aps in the data without negatively impacting the algorithm ability to predict 
from new data. And to deploy the algorithm and automatise the whole process to continuously 
update the database and increase the algorithm ability to predict .

The previous steps in this project were made with different teams. See individual 
repositories for more informations about the teams.
